# Complete Setup Checklist

## Implementation Status: 100% COMPLETE

All code has been implemented and is ready to use!

## Setup Checklist

### Phase 1: Python Environment (Can be automated)
- [x] Python installed
- [ ] Python dependencies installed → Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Kaggle CLI installed → Run: `pip install kaggle`

### Phase 2: Dataset  (Requires Kaggle account)
- [ ] Kaggle API credentials set up
  - Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/account
  - Create API token
  - Place `kaggle.json` in `~/.kaggle/` or `C:\Users\<user>\.kaggle\`
- [ ] Dataset downloaded → Run: `python download_dataset.py`

### Phase 3: Model Training  (Takes 30-60 min)
- [ ] Model trained → Run: `python train_model.py`
- [ ] Model file exists: `models/densenet121_emotion_model.h5`

### Phase 4: Services  (Start when ready)
- [ ] ML Service running → `python ml_service/app.py`
- [ ] Backend running → `npm start` in `backend/`
- [ ] Frontend running → `npm start` in `frontend/`

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies
cd ml_service
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download dataset (after Kaggle setup)
python download_dataset.py

# 3. Train model
python train_model.py

# 4. Start ML service (Terminal 1)
python app.py

# 5. Start backend (Terminal 2)
cd ../backend
npm start

# 6. Start frontend (Terminal 3)
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

## What's Already Complete
