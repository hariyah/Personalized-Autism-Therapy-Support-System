# Personalized-Autism-Therapy-Support-System

## OVERALL PROJECT OVERVIEW
A web-based AI-powered platform that helps parents, guardians, and therapists deliver personalized autism care through intelligent analytics, behavior tracking, and real-time therapy recommendations.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide, making it a major global public health concern. ASD is highly heterogeneous—each child presents a unique combination of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social traits that vary in type, severity, and developmental trajectory. As a result, generalized, one-size-fits-all intervention strategies are often ineffective.

Parents and caregivers frequently struggle to interpret clinical assessments and translate them into meaningful daily interventions. Existing digital tools are largely static, fragmented, and non-adaptive, offering limited personalization or real-time feedback. Therapists, particularly in low-resource settings, face challenges in maintaining continuous monitoring, tracking progress objectively, and updating therapy plans based on reliable data.

To address these gaps, this project proposes an end-to-end AI-powered autism support ecosystem that combines explainable machine learning, real-time emotion analysis, personalized activity recommendations, and intelligent caregiver–therapist collaboration. The system is designed to be individualized, adaptive, interpretable, and accessible, ensuring practical impact in both clinical and home-based environments.

## PROJECT COMPONENTS OVERVIEW
### 1. Explainable AI for Personalized Autism Trait-Based Analysis (Autism DSM-5 Severity Classifier)

This component analyzes multi-dimensional child data to classify autism severity levels aligned with DSM-5 criteria.

### 2. Autism AI-Powered Cognitive Activity Recommender

Based on severity classification and individual cognitive profiles, this module recommends customized cognitive activities such as memory games, attention-building tasks, and problem-solving exercises.

### 3. AI-Driven Personalized Behavioral, Emotional & Social Therapy Activity Recommendation System

This component focuses on behavioral regulation, emotional understanding, and social skill development, integrating real-time emotion recognition.

### 4. AI-Assisted Caregiver–Therapist Collaboration System (ACT-CS)

A Web-Based Voice-Driven Intelligent Autism Therapy Support System, ACT-CS serves as the communication and coordination backbone of the project.

## OVERALL IMPACT

Together, these four components form a unified, intelligent, and adaptive autism support system that:

- Moves beyond static assessments to continuous, personalized care

- Empowers caregivers with understandable AI-driven guidance

- Provides therapists with structured, objective, and evolving insights

- Ensures therapy is child-specific, explainable, and data-backed

By combining Explainable AI, real-time emotion awareness, personalized activity recommendation, and collaborative decision-making, this project aims to significantly improve autism intervention outcomes and accessibility worldwide.
