Personalized-Autism-Therapy-Support-System
A web-based AI-powered platform that helps parents, guardians, and therapists deliver personalized autism care through intelligent analytics, behavior tracking, and real-time therapy recommendations.
 AI-Assisted Caregiver–Therapist Collaboration System for Autism Support (ACT-CS)
Final Year Research Project – PP1 (Checklist Submission)
 Project Overview
This project presents an AI-Assisted Caregiver–Therapist Collaboration System for Autism Support, designed to improve communication and response efficiency between caregivers and therapists using voice-based AI processing.
Caregivers often describe a child’s behavior verbally, which can be time-consuming and difficult for therapists to analyze at scale. This system enables caregivers to submit voice notes, which are automatically processed using speech and natural language processing models to generate structured insights for therapists.

The system performs:
  Voice → Text transcription
  Issue identification
  Urgency assessment
  Therapist-friendly summarization
The final output supports decision-making, not diagnosis, and aims to reduce therapist workload while improving response prioritization.

  Main Objectives
 Build a voice-based AI pipeline for autism caregiver reporting
 Train and compare multiple Transformer-based NLP models
 Select the best-performing models based on evaluation
 Develop a web application (frontend + backend) for real-world interaction
 Demonstrate software engineering best practices and reproducibility

  Models Used

  Speech-to-Text (ASR)

 Model: Whisper-small
 Framework: HuggingFace Transformers
 Input: Caregiver voice recordings
 Output: Clean text transcript

  Issue Classification
 Models Trained:
   DistilBERT (baseline)
   RoBERTa (final)
   DeBERTa (comparison)

 Final Selected Model: RoBERTa-base
 Performance: Test Accuracy ≈ 100%, Weighted F1 ≈ 100%
 Reason for Selection:
   Best performance–efficiency trade-off
   Faster inference than DeBERTa
   Suitable for deployment

Saved Model Folder:


models/issue_classifier_roberta/

  Urgency Classification
 Models Trained:
   DistilBERT (final)
   RoBERTa (comparison)

 Final Selected Model: DistilBERT
 Performance: Test Accuracy ≈ 85–95%
 Reason for Selection:
   Simpler classification task
   Strong baseline performance
   Lightweight and efficient

Saved Model Folder:
